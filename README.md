# SoftwareSecurity
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The Client is Artemis Financial and they are looking for a cipher algorythm to secure their data and their client's software. This includes secure communications bewtween the client and servers for the company.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I feel like the bes thing that I discovered was the vulenerabilities within the software code and to find the correct way of secure the code. This is important to protect all the data that is stored by the company to help secure their customers information and assests.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
THe hardest part of to find all the flaws within the code. Some of the issues stood out like sore thumbs but other ones were more hidden and harder to pin down to secure that part of the code.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
A lot of the increasing layer sof secure is to test the coding in a secure enviroment to ensure that things are actually secure. Another technique is to ensure everything is up to date at this is important because it can secure other things that you might not have seen. The last thing I would do is have someone else test trying to break your code because there is always more than one way to do things.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Checksums were a great help to identify any errors that could have been in the coding and helped resolve anything that was a major issue. I say major issue because there is always a chance for false positives based on how the code is intereacted with. False positives however do give you insight into things that might never have been pinged as and issue but could become one if not properly secured in future updates.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
A lot of tools I used were already built into ecilpse or provided by the professor in assisting with checksums or dependancies. Personal research is another thing I had to due when dealing with certifications and that was becuase of personal mistakes and I had to find ways around those mistakes to keep going with the assignments.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The biggest thing I learned from this assignment and even thos course is to ensure coding is correct even on things that might not look like they have an effect on how the overall program runs. This is important because it allows you to see how the code will interact with multiuple things, even things you never intended the program to interact with. Learning this was important because our career and technology is constantly evolving and changing and we must be able to adapt to the changing world.
